## Machine Learning
For reasoning and knowledge creation, the AI would need an internal model of the world. This paper - [Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent](https://yashsharma79.github.io/files/Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent.pdf). proposes way to build up a simple version of such model and a representation. Prior knowledge of energy, mass and volume is built into the agent. Prediction error is triggered by change in state of objects, which must be resolved by combining causal inference and gradient descent. An external memory is available to the agent in order to compile knowledge that can amortize discovery over multiple inferences.

The agent would be equipped with an external memory to record data about the interventions it runs on these atoms. The aim is to generate data with all the interventions that are possible in such a simple but real world. The inference to draw is what behaviour a form of matter would produce under different interventions.
