I am curious about causal inference and automated reasoning. Please check out my work here:
[Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent](https://yashsharma79.github.io/files/Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent.pdf)

I update this paper regularly. I am very interested in combining the tenets of deep learning - backpropagation and gradient descent with causal modelling.
