For reasoning and knowledge creation, the AI would need an internal model of the world. This paper proposes way to build up a simple version of such model and a representation. Prior knowledge of energy, mass and volume of is built into the agent. Prediction error is triggered by change in state of objects, which must be resolved by combining causal inference and gradient descent. An external memory is available to the agent in order to compile knowledge that can amortize discovery over multiple inferences.

Please check out my work here:
[Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent](https://yashsharma79.github.io/files/Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent.pdf). I update this paper regularly. 

I am very interested about combining error-correcting mechanisms with causal modelling. I am curious about causal inference and automated reasoning.
