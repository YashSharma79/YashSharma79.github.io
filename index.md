## Research Interests
For reasoning and knowledge creation, the AI would need an internal model of the world. This paper - [Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent](https://yashsharma79.github.io/files/Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent.pdf). proposes way to build up a simple version of such model and a representation.

Prior knowledge of energy, mass and volume is built into the agent. Prediction error is triggered by change in state of objects. An external memory is available to the agent in order to compile knowledge that can amortize discovery over multiple inferences. The environment to learn would be a model that contains hydrogen atoms and ions that will provide the agent with a reference of unit mass, charge and energy.
## Work
I have worked on constraint programming, operations research and Virtual Reality. I have contributed to designing software that is being used by the top companies in India to optimise their logistics. I have contributed to a Virtual Reality product that lets people validate machine designs. I have been an early stage programmer for two startups and contributed to product design.

## What ideas inspire me?
The scientific ideas of AI particularly the mathematics of causality and the backpropagation algorithm. These simple and profound ideas make me realise the reach of simplicity and good explanations.
