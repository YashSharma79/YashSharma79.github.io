### Research Interests

I am curious about causal inference and automated reasoning. Please check out my work here:
[Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent](https://yashsharma79.github.io/files/Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent.pdf)

I update this paper regularly. I am very interested in combining the tenets of deep learning - backpropagation and gradient descent with causal modelling.

### Work
I have worked on constraint programming, operations research. Previously, i have worked on Virtual Reality. I have contributed to designing software that is being by logistics companies in India. I have developed my coding skills by creating games. I have been an early stage programmer for two startups and hence contributed significantly to product design.

### Projects
* [Virtual Reality to Treat Phobias](https://github.com/YashSharma79/Phobia-VR)
* [Green Age (a platformer game)](https://github.com/YashSharma79/Green-Age)
