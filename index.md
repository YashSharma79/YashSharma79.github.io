### Research Interests

I am curious about causal inference and automated reasoning. Please check out my work here:
Abstract:
For reasoning and knowledge creation, the AI would need an internal model of the world. This paper proposes way to build up a simple version of such model and a representation. Prior knowledge of energy, mass and volume of is built into the agent. Prediction error is triggered by change in state of objects, which must be resolved by combining causal inference and gradient descent. An external memory is available to the agent in order to compile knowledge that can amortize discovery over multiple inferences.

[Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent](https://yashsharma79.github.io/files/Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent.pdf)

I update this paper regularly. I am very interested in combining the tenets of machine learning i.e backpropagation and gradient descent, with causal modelling.

### Work
I have worked on constraint programming, operations research. Previously, i have worked on Virtual Reality. I have contributed to designing software that is being by logistics companies in India. I have developed my coding skills by creating games. I have been an early stage programmer for two startups and contributed to product design.
