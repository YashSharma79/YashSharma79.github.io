## Present work
* Cross-modal representation learning - Combining video, text and image data to extract correlations
* Research Assistant at the Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science.<
* Working on computing entanglement entropy at the Quantum Information Center.



## Research Interests
For reasoning and knowledge creation, the AI would need an internal model of the world. I am working on a paper - [Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference](https://yashsharma79.github.io/files/Modelling knowledge representation about matter through causal inference and gradient descent.pdf). proposes way to build up a simple version of such model and a representation.

Prior knowledge of energy, mass and volume is built into the agent. Prediction error is triggered by change in state of objects. An external memory is available to the agent in order to compile knowledge that can amortize discovery over multiple inferences.
