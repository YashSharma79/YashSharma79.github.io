* [Trust Model For Cloud Computing (a platformer game)](https://github.com/YashSharma79/Trust-Model-for-Cloud)
    * Simulated cloud environments to evaluate their reliability(availability/downtime) and security
    * Measured cloud performance against different encryption protocols and identity management levels
* [Capturing errors in industrial accidents](https://github.com/YashSharma79/industrial-accidents)
    * Inferred most probable sensor measurements present prior to accidents, with ML
    * Currently developing model to infer causal relations that led to errors
* [Green Age](https://github.com/YashSharma79/Green-Age)
