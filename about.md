I spend my time learning about AI and Physics. There have been 3 moments in my life when my mind has been blown and all those have come very recently (after i graduated). First when i understood what the double-slit experiment was. Second, when i saw Cantor's proof of how some infinities are bigger than others. Third, when i when read about Bell's inequality.
