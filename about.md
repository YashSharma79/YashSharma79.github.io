### Personal
I spend my time learning about AI and Physics. There have been 3 moments in my life when my mind has been blown and all those have come very recently (after i graduated). First when i understood what the double-slit experiment was. Second, when i saw Cantor's proof of how some infinities are bigger than others. Third, when i when read about Bell's inequality.

### Work
I have worked on constraint programming, operations research and Virtual Reality. I have contributed to designing software that is being used by the top companies in India to optimise their logistics. I have contributed to a Virtual Reality product that lets people validate machine designs. I have been an early stage programmer for two startups and contributed to product design.
