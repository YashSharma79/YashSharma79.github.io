### Personal
I spend my time learning about AI and Physics. There have been 3 moments in my life when my mind has been blown and all those have come very recently (after i graduated). First when i understood what the double-slit experiment was. Second, when i saw Cantor's proof of how some infinities are bigger than others. Third, when i when read about Bell's inequality.

I write songs and play guitar and piano which i post on [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4uGvM9OhH8Ij-i7XolDXSg). I have performed my songs in public, ran half-marathons (gonna do a full-marathon in 2021 when they start again), and love trekking (haven't done that in a while).

### Work
I have worked on constraint programming, operations research and Virtual Reality. I have contributed to designing software that is being used by the top companies in India to optimise their logistics. I have contributed to a Virtual Reality product that lets people validate machine designs. I have been an early stage programmer for two startups and contributed to product design.

### Advice/Quotes that i keep in mind
* Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning "on demand" (i.e don't learn bottom-up breadth wise)
                                        - _Andrej Karpathy_
* We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.
                                        - _Roy Amara_
* Problems are inevitable. Problems are soluble.
                                        - _David Deutsch_
